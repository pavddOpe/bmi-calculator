# BMI Calculator

Simple web-based BMI calculator built as a small personal project and part of my analytics portfolio.

### What it does
Enter your name (optional), weight in kilograms (kg) and height in meters (m) → get your BMI value and weight category (Underweight / Normal weight / Overweight / Obese / Severely obese / Morbidly obese).

### How it was made
- Written in **Python**
- Developed in **Visual Studio Code**
- Originally created as a Jupyter notebook using ipywidgets + Voila for interactive widgets
- Later prettified and deployed as a clean web app using **Gradio** on **Hugging Face Spaces**
- Pushed to **GitHub** for version control and sharing

### Live version

### A few notes
- Measurements are intentionally in **kg** and **m** (standard scientific/medical units)
- Getting the deployment working (especially matching files, Docker vs Gradio SDK, port issues, CSP errors, etc.) was surprisingly challenging — still learning a lot about web deployment, containers and cloud platforms through this project

Feedback welcome!
